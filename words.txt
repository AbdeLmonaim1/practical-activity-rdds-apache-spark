Spark is a distributed processing engine designed for big data analytics.
Spark can process large data very fast compared to traditional systems.
Many companies choose Spark because Spark is fast, reliable and scalable.
With Spark, data engineers can write applications using Python, Java or Scala.
The Spark ecosystem includes Spark SQL, Spark Streaming and Spark MLlib.
Big data platforms combine Spark with Hadoop to process petabytes of data.
When data becomes very large, Spark helps organizations save processing time.
Modern systems require fast data processing and fast decision making.
Data scientists and data engineers rely on Spark for training machine learning models.
A single Spark cluster can handle both streaming data and batch data.
In many use cases, Spark performs better because Spark keeps data in memory.
Spark transformations are lazy and Spark actions trigger execution.
Big data applications rely on distributed nodes to process large data efficiently.
When Spark is used properly, Spark can significantly improve performance on big data problems.
